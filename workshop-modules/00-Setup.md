# Workshop Setup

We'll explain Git's and Fork's and some of the basics of GitHub shortly, but assuming you've made it to this repository the first thing you want to do is 'Fork' this repository into your personal GitHub repositories.

To do this:

- Click the 'fork' button, which is on the right side of the title bar for this workshop repository
- On the next page, set:
    - the owner to be your personal account
    - the name to be 'wordsearchgame'
    - You can leave the description as is
    - Leave copy the main branch only checked
- Finally, hit 'create fork', to complete the process

This creates a copy of the workshop repository in your personal repos, and will also creates a connection so you can sync with the original repo, and gives you a means to contribute back to a repository.

Importantly, this has provided you with the codespace definition that we'll be using to run the workshop.
