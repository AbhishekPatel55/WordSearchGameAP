## New to GitHub?

### And I'm not sure I should be using a personal account?

At [Arkahna](https://arkahna.io), we recommend the use of personal GitHub account for contributing to work repositories.

Using your personal GitHub account for work purposes and connecting it with your work email can have several advantages. Firstly, it promotes transparency and collaboration within the department. When your work contributions are tied to your personal GitHub account, it becomes easier for colleagues to locate and collaborate with you on projects, creating a more open and accessible work environment that encourages teamwork and knowledge sharing.

Secondly, it empowers employees to take control of their work and professional development. By utilising your personal GitHub account, you build a visible track record of your contributions and skills, both within and outside the workplace. This serves as a powerful tool for career growth, as it showcases your expertise to potential employers and keeps you motivated to continually enhance your skills.

Furthermore, using a personal GitHub account can simplify workflows and reduce administrative complexity by eliminating the need to manage separate work-related GitHub accounts. Overall, this approach fosters a culture of collaboration, transparency, and personal growth, benefiting both the individual and the organization.

### And don't have an account yet?

The first thing to do is create your own GitHub account. This will be a personal account you can use for other code you write also. There are a few [guidelines](#general-guidelines-for-the-account-to-be-used) we recommend to ensure it represents you professionally.

## Already have a GitHub account?

You can bring your personal GitHub account to write code with us. It needs to meet a few [guidelines](#general-guidelines-for-the-account-to-be-used). If you would prefer, you can create a second personal account to use for work purposes.

## General Guidelines for the account to be used.

If you're looking for some guidance on the professional bar for personal accounts, look no further. 

When you establish a GitHub COE you should formalise these as account requirements, and back it up with your own GitHub policy... and if you're not sure where to start [Arkahna](https://arkahna.io) can help you with this too

### Account Suggestions

You **must** have your name set to your Real name

Your profile picture **should** be a professional headshot, and must not be a cartoon or meme or other work inappropriate images.

You **may** make your profile private at https://github.com/settings/profile if you are concerned about privacy.

You **must** have a work appropriate (not offensive etc) handle, preferably your name so your account can be easily identified.

You **must** associate your work email addresswith your account.

You **may** configure notifications to be sent to your work email address, if you do not do this, you will not receive email notifications.

##### In short, if your GitHub profile is not a good representation of yourself then you should not use it for work.

If creating a work specific GitHub account, it **should** be named `firstname.lastname.work` or similar.

### Two factor authentication

All users **must** have two factor authentication enabled on their account. This is to ensure that if a user's password is compromised, the attacker will not be able to access the account.

Here are instructions on [how to enable two factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).


## I have my account ready, now what?
